This the Module 2 Project for the Sinatra Section at Flatiron School

It is an anime calendar that used the Jikan API(www.jikan.moe) to access the information from the MyAnimeList webiste: www.myanimelist,net. It uses the Titles, Synopsis and Image fromthe websit and creates a schedule that I a user can add anime to based on the day that the show airs on.
